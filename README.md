# **Student Performance-BD: Analyzing Academic Outcomes Using EDA & Hybrid Models**

## **Overview**
This project aims to analyze and predict the academic performance of students from various regions in Bangladesh. Using the **Student Performance-BD** dataset, which includes 24 attributes related to demographics, academic metrics, extracurricular activities, and other factors, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and develop a **Hybrid Machine Learning Model** to predict students' academic success.

The insights from this project can be used to identify key factors influencing academic outcomes and help guide students in choosing the most suitable educational path based on their individual profiles.

## **Dataset**
The **Student Performance-BD** dataset contains information about students' demographics, academic performance, extracurricular participation, and other relevant factors. Key attributes include:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Residence (Urban/Rural)
- **Educational Background**: Academic level, Group (Science/Commerce), etc.
- **Academic Scores**: English, Math, Science, Social Science, etc.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in activities like art/culture.
- **Other Factors**: Attendance, Type of school (Private/Govt/Semi-Govt), etc.

## **Project Goals**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- Preprocess the data for machine learning model training.
- Develop a **Hybrid Machine Learning Model** combining multiple algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Predict student academic performance across various subjects.
- Evaluate and visualize model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **ROC-AUC**.
